## What version of Welle does this guide cover?

This guide covers Welle 1.2.


## What version of Riak does this guide cover?

[Secondary indexes in Riak](http://wiki.basho.com/Secondary-Indexes.html) are supported starting with Riak 1.0 and only by buckets
that use [LevelDB storage backend](http://wiki.basho.com/LevelDB.html).


## Introduction

According to Wikipedia, a [database index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index) is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations.
*Secondary indexes* are indexes on keys other then the primary key (the one you specify when storing a value in Riak). For example, if an application has
accounts that look like this:

{% gist 3fba04eb3b7acbd32b2a %}

then it may be desirable to be able to find an account with the given email so that it can be authenticated. One approach would be to use email
as primary key but it is not always possible or practical. Secondary indexes is what makes it possible to *efficiently* retrieve an account
with a particular email.


## Secondary Indexes in Riak

Many databases (for example, PostgreSQL or Oracle) require indexes to be created before you can execute queries over them. In addition, they
(typically) create index entries for every inserted row (this behavior can be made conditional in PostgreSQL). This works well when schema is
fixed and known upfront but this is not the case with Riak. Riak treats stored values as "bags of bytes" and they can have any shape.

Because of that, secondary indexes work differently with Riak. With Riak, index entries (field/value pairs) are specified when a value is stored.
Then, every time the value is updated, index entries may change and reindexing will happen. In other words, secondary indexes are flexible, just
like the schema.

Riak supports two kinds of 2i queries: value (also known as "equality") and range. The email example falls into the former category, while
timestamp-based queries like "all events between 3 days ago and today" fall into the latter.


## Indexing stored values

To specify index entries on a stored value, use the `:indexes` option of `clojurewerkz.welle.kv/store` function:

{% gist c9f1330b3a89866084a6 %}

`:indexes` value must be a map where keys are names of indexed fields (that can be keywords or strings) and values are **sets** of values.
It is common to have just one value in a set like in the example above, but there also may be more than one:

{% gist 7375f61f80c70a9b8cb6 %}

If you need to index date/time values, use timestamps (longs):

{% gist bef74c38df0a4cc00066 %}

For anything that involves working with date, time or timestamp values, it is highly recommended that you use [clj-time](https://github.com/seancorfield/clj-time) and its convenient
[coercion functions](https://github.com/seancorfield/clj-time/blob/master/src/clj_time/coerce.clj)


## Secondary index queries

As it was mentioned before, there are two types of 2i queries in Riak: value (equality) and range queries. Both are performed using the same function,
`clojurewerkz.welle.kv/index-query` that takes a bucket name, a field to query against and a field value. Here is a value query example:

{% gist 94dcaacd60dd4e37331e %}

To perform a range query, pass a vector of two range boundaries as the field value:

{% gist 3dab20b1d76d2a3f28c5 %}

`clojurewerkz.welle.kv/index-query` returns **a collection of keys** as its result. You then use those keys to fetch associated objects.


## Wrapping up

Secondary indexes in Riak are Ã  la carte, just like schema of stored values. They greatly enhance Riak's querying capabilities. Using them
with Welle is straightforward, just like it should be.


## What to read next

The documentation is organized as a number of guides, covering all kinds of topics.

We recommend that you read the following guides first, if possible, in this order:

 * [Links and link walking](/articles/links.html)
 * [Map/Reduce](/articles/mapreduce.html)
 * [Integration with 3rd party libraries](/articles/integration.html)
