## What Version of Welle Does This Guide Cover?

This guide covers Welle 2.0, including development releases.


## Introduction

[Riak Links](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/theory/concepts/Links/) are metadata that
establish one-way relationships between objects in Riak. They can be
used to loosely model graph like relationships between objects in
Riak.

Much like [secondary indexes](/2i.html), links are specified Ã  la
carte, when a value is stored. It is then possible to traverse links
(a process known as **link walking**) to collect related values.


## Storing Links With Values

Links are specified using the `:links` option of
`clojurewerkz.welle.kv/store` function. Each link is a map with three
keys:

``` clojure
{:bucket "people" :key "joe" :tag "friend"}
```

Bucket and key identify the value being referenced. Tag is a kind of
relationship (some graph databases call it **relationship type**)

In the following example, we create a `friend` link to express
friendship between two people:

``` clojure
(kv/store conn "people" "joe" {:name "Joe" :age 30} {:content-type "application/clojure"})
(kv/store conn "people" "jane" {:name "Jane" :age 32}
          {:content-type "application/clojure"
           :links [{:bucket bucket-name :key "joe" :tag "friend"}]})
```


## Link Walking

To traverse a sequence links, use link walking DSL functions from the
`clojurewerkz.welle.links` namespace:

``` clojure
(ns my.app
  (:require [clojurewerkz.welle.links :refer :all]))

;; finding friends
(walk
  (start-at "people" "jane")
  (step     "people" "friend" true))
```

The `walk` function takes traversal starting point (specified here
using the `clojurewerkz.welle.links/start-at` function) as the first
argument and one or more steps as remaining arguments. Each step is
specified using the `clojurewerkz.welle.links/step` function and
consists of

 * A bucket name
 * A link tag to use
 * Accumulator flag

If the accumulator flag is true, values found at the given step will
be included in the end result. In our example above we want to find
friends of a particular person so we set the flag to `true`. If we
wanted to find friends of friends of the person instead, we would use
two steps and only included values found during the last step into the
final result set:

``` clojure
(ns my.app
  (:require [clojurewerkz.welle.links :refer :all]))

;; finding friends of friends
(walk
  (start-at "people" "jane")
  (step     "people" "friend" false)
  (step     "people" "friend" true))
```


## Wrapping Up

While Riak is not a graph database like [Neo4J](http://neo4j.org) or
[Titan](http://thinkaurelius.github.com/titan/), links can cover many
common scenarios, such as articles and comments or events and
participants (when there are reasons to not denormalize associated
values into the parent).


## What to read next

The documentation is organized as a number of guides, covering all kinds of topics.

We recommend that you read the following guides first, if possible, in this order:

 * [Map/Reduce](/articles/mapreduce.html)
 * [Integration with 3rd party libraries](/articles/integration.html)
